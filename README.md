This repository contains a collection of exercises, projects, and content related to my study and practice of assembly language. 
The goal of this project is to document and share my progress and understanding of assembly language, which is essential for both university courses and the challenges presented by 42 School.

#### Objectives:
- Personal Learning: Consolidate my knowledge of assembly language through continuous practice and the resolution of complex problems.
- University Content: Provide a solid foundation for university courses related to computer architecture and low-level programming.
- 42 School Projects: Apply and refine my assembly language skills for projects and challenges at 42 School.
